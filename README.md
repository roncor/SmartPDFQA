# SmartPDFQA - AI Chatbot for PDFs with ChromaDB & Azure OpenAI
SmartPDFQA is an AI-powered chatbot that **reads and understands PDFs**. It allows users to **ask questions**, and **Azure OpenAI answers in a natural way**, using **only** the information stored in the PDFs.

## **How It Works**
**It reads all the PDFs you put in the Libros folder**  
**The system processes them**, extracting text and creating **high-quality embeddings** with Hugging Face
**Embeddings are stored in ChromaDB**, a powerful vector database for fast searches 
**When a user asks a question**, ChromaDB finds the most relevant PDF content  
**Azure OpenAI generates a natural response**, using only the retrieved data
